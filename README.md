# data-visualization

To run:

First you need to run the index.js file.

```node .```

This will create a new compressed_stats.json file (I have left one as a default)

To view, go to the view folder and open the charts.html file.

The frontend presentation of the charts can be improved, and would be one of the first things I would do.
